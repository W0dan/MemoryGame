# MemoryGame

With this game i'm trying to get a grasp on multiplayer-game development. It is actually meant as a case-study for future multiplayer-games I might develop.

If anyone is interested to take a look at the code, feel free to do so and please do not hesitate to give feedback !

weird thing: when I host in a console application, I don't have any problems with calling into a callback service of the instance initiating a call to the service, but in wpf this doesn't seem to work ..
