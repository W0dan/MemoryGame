# MemoryGame

With this game I'm trying to get a grasp on multiplayer-game development. It is actually meant as a case-study for future multiplayer-games I might develop.

If anyone is interested to take a look at the code, feel free to do so and please do not hesitate to give feedback !

The version you can download with the link below should be pretty stable. Should you encounter any unexpected behaviour (crashes etc.), please let me know.
